Suggestions (to discuss):
 
  
- attempts not showing in uploader (refactor )

  'Uploaded 350 datapoints in 0.12 seconds in 1 attempt(s)'
  'Failed with 350 datapoints in 10.52 seconds in 3 attempt(s)'

- can try - how risky and how long is this: Dataset(dt).upload() ?

- webhook idea for kep (upload on change of source repo)

- hide API token

- move mardown and timer to helpers?

# Suggestions (to discuss):
 
- heroku's actual cron - deploys nothing yet
   
- attempts not showing in uploader

#      'Uploaded 350 datapoints in 0.12 seconds in 1 attempt(s)'
#      'Failed with 350 datapoints in 10.52 seconds in 3 attempt(s)'

- can try - how risky and how long is this: Dataset(dt).upload() ?

- webhook idea for kep

- hide token
